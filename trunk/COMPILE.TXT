To compile you need Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 SP6 with Platform SDK 2003.
You can use batch build feature to automate builds.
If you build manually, you need to compile KEXCRT and PREP projects first as other projects rely on them.
To build KEXCONTROL you have to build debug CORE first.
KEXBASES and KEXBASEN projects rely on CORE be built first.
