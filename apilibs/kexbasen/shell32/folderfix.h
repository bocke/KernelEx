/* 
 * The purpose of the fix is that the Start Menu in Windows 98 
 * and Windows Me don't display any items from "All Users\Start Menu" folder.
 * Thus the fix is to redirect CSIDL_COMMON_* to approperiate CSIDL_* folders.
 *
 * Interesingly Desktop displays icons from "All Users\Desktop"...
 *
 * This fix is applied to following functions:
 * SHGetFolderPathA (both SHELL32 and SHFOLDER)
 * SHGetFolderPathW (both SHELL32 and SHFOLDER)
 * SHGetFolderLocation
 * SHGetSpecialFolderPathA
 * SHGetSpecialFolderPathW
 * SHGetSpecialFolderLocation
