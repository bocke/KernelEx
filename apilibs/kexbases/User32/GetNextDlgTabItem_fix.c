/* Here we have fix for retarded situation.
 * 9x stucks trying to get next control in dialog to tab
 * when there is only one control on dialog, and it has tab-able
 *  child windows (WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT), and if it's disabled or hidden,
 * user.exe crashes with stack overflow, silently or soundly.
 * More proper fix would be to scan whole dialog and enable/show at least
 * one such window, since GetNextDlgTabItem also happens internally.
 * However, likely it won't be this function and our case works for
 * Winamp ML.
